3 scripts needed:
  - installation script (install.sh)
  - uninstallation script (uninstall.sh)
  - binary (gitflux.sh)

---

All the scripts need to be added to PATH so as to be accessed globally.
The binary script needs to be symlinked.
 - the application should be run by `gitflux` and not `./gitflux.sh`.
